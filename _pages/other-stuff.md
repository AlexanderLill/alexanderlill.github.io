## Beyond Work

When I'm not building AI systems, writing code, or researching developer productivity, I have a few other passions that keep me busy.

## Open Source Contributor (Trying!)

I'm trying to be an active open source contributor. While my day job keeps me busy, I believe in giving back to the community that has given me so much. Here are some of my projects:

### CVSS score calculation for latex
A LaTeX implementation for CVSSv3 Base Score Calculation. This tool helps security researchers and professionals include properly formatted CVSS scores in their academic papers and reports.

**Repository**: [github.com/alexanderlill/cvss3tex](https://github.com/alexanderlill/cvss3tex)

### Portfolio Tracking Parsers

I've built several parsers for a portfolio management tool to ingest crypto and peer-to-peer lending data:

- **PP-Crypto-Parser**: Parser for Kraken exchange data for Portfolio Performance software
- **PP-P2P-Parser**: Parser for P2P lending platforms

These tools help people track their investments.

**Repositories**: 
- [github.com/alexanderlill/PP-Crypto-Parser](https://github.com/alexanderlill/PP-Crypto-Parser)
- [github.com/alexanderlill/PP-P2P-Parser](https://github.com/alexanderlill/PP-P2P-Parser)

## Side Projects

I love building tools that solve real problems. These projects combine my skills as a [software engineer](/software-engineer/), [AI engineer](/ai-engineer/), and [researcher](/productivity-researcher/):

### AI Job Scoring System (2025)
A tool that gathers current job openings and scores them according to user interests and skills using AI. Built with Python, pandas, and pydanticAI – applying my AI engineering skills to a personal productivity challenge.

### Financial Transaction Analysis (2020-2024)
A data processing pipeline that categorizes financial transactions into topics and subtopics automatically. Helps with budgeting and financial awareness.

### Research Paper Network Visualization (2018-2020)
A prototype application that visualizes the network of citations between research papers, making it easier to explore academic literature. Built with friends, Golang, and D3.js.

### Bug Tracking Bot (2017-2024)
A bot that semi-automatically documents discussions about software bugs by transferring Slack conversations to issue tracking systems (Redmine, Trello, GitLab, Wrike). Saves developers time and ensures nothing gets lost (Built as part of the MOVE-II project).

### Social Event Organizer (2016)
A prototype web application for organizing social events like movie nights or cooking together. Built as part of a fullstack certificate with Node.js and MongoDB.

## Community Involvement

I've also been involved in civic engagement:

- **Founding and Board Member** of the Pirate Party Germany - District Association Ingolstadt (2009-2014)
- Organized events, projects, and task forces
- Created and published press releases
- Focused on digital rights, privacy, and transparency

## Teaching & Sharing Knowledge

I've taught courses at the VHS Ingolstadt (Adult Education Center) on:
- Efficient computer workflows
- IT security & privacy

I believe in making technology accessible and helping people understand how to use it safely and effectively.
