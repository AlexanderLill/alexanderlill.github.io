## Current Role

Since June 2025, I work as an **AI Engineer** at the [appliedAI Initiative GmbH](https://www.appliedai.de/) in Munich, Germany, where I design and develop agentic AI solutions for enterprise use cases.

## What I Do

I specialize in building **LLM-powered solutions** using modern orchestration frameworks and take on technical leadership to deliver prototypes that align with stakeholder needs. My work focuses on:

- **Agentic AI Solutions**: Designing intelligent systems using orchestration frameworks like LangGraph and LangChain
- **Technical Leadership**: Delivering prototypes end-to-end and aligning technical solutions with business requirements
- **Engineering Best Practices**: Driving maintainable AI workflows for enterprise environments and software engineering best practices
- **Team Enablement**: Leading internal knowledge sharing on AI tooling, architecture, and best practices
- **Developer Productivity**: Applying my expertise to improve team workflows and code reusability

## Technologies & Tools

I work with cutting-edge AI technologies including:
- **LLM Frameworks**: LangGraph, LangChain, LangSmith, LangFuse, PydanticAI
- **AI Infrastructure**: Ollama, LiteLLM, Azure AI
- **Development**: Python, FastAPI, Docker
- **Techniques**: Prompt Engineering, Context Engineering, Agentic Workflows

## Background in AI Research

During my Ph.D. research (2020-2024), I designed **AI-driven developer tools** using generative AI to boost productivity. This included building tools for knowledge management, personal information management, and automated question answering using technologies like LangChain, Ollama, and Transformers.

My research background gives me a unique perspective on building AI solutions that are not just technically sound, but also genuinely useful for end users. Learn more about my [research on developer productivity](/productivity-researcher/).

## Bringing Together Multiple Perspectives

My work as an AI Engineer builds on my diverse background:
- **[Software Engineering](/software-engineer/)**: 15+ years of building systems gives me practical insights into what works in real-world applications
- **[Research Experience](/productivity-researcher/)**: My Ph.D. taught me how to validate ideas through rigorous user studies and experiments
- **[Space Industry](/space-enthusiast/)**: Working on mission-critical satellite systems taught me the importance of reliability and systematic engineering
