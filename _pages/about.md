Hello and welcome to my website!

My name is Alexander Lill, and I am an AI Engineer working at the [appliedAI Initiative](https://www.appliedai.de/) since July 2025.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [TH Ingolstadt (THI)](https://www.thi.de/) in 2015 and my master's degree in Computer Science from the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/) in 2018.

During my master's degree, I also was a member of the [MOVE-II Nanosatellite Student Project](https://warr.de/projects/move/), where I was the lead software engineer and responsible for planning and coordinating the development of the on-board software and the mission control software, which were developed using agile practices. The MOVE-II CubeSat was launched into low Earth orbit on the [3rd of December 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq8kS6UoOrQ) and deorbited on the [13th of July 2025](https://celestrak.org/NORAD/elements/graph-altitude.php?CATNR=43780) after almost 7 years of operations.

After my master's degree, I joined the [European Space Agency (ESA)](https://www.esa.int/) in the Netherlands, where I was a trainee in the Software Systems Division working on Mission Control Systems from 2018 to 2020.

Since September 2020, I am a research assistant and Ph.D. student at the Human Aspects of Software Engineering Lab (HASEL) at the University of Zurich (UZH), where I focus on Software Developer Productivity, supervised by [Prof. Thomas Fritz](https://hasel.dev/team/thomas-fritz/).
