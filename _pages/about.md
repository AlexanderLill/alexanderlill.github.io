## Hey there! 👋

I'm Alexander Lill – and I wear many hats (sometimes all at once).

I'm an **AI Engineer** at the [appliedAI Initiative](https://www.appliedai.de/), where I design agentic AI solutions using LLMs and orchestration frameworks. *[More info here →](/ai-engineer/)*

I'm a **Software Engineer** who's been building systems since my apprenticeship in 2007, from embedded satellite software to modern web applications. *[More info here →](/software-engineer/)*

I'm a **Productivity Researcher** finishing my Ph.D. at the University of Zurich, where I study how developers work and build AI-powered tools to make them more productive. *[More info here →](/productivity-researcher/)*

And I'm a **Space Enthusiast** who helped build software for the MOVE-II satellite and worked at the European Space Agency. *[More info here →](/space-enthusiast/)*

## My Journey

I started my career with an **apprenticeship as a Computer Science Expert** at a hospital in Ingolstadt, learning the fundamentals of system administration and software development. I earned my **Bachelor's** (2015) and **Master's** (2018) degrees in Computer Science, both with distinction, from universities in Bavaria. *[More info here →](/software-engineer/)*

During my master's at TUM, I became **Lead Software Engineer** for the [MOVE-II CubeSat](https://warr.de/projects/move/) – a student-built satellite that launched in December 2018 and operated for almost 7 years in orbit! I led teams, defined architectures, and brought agile practices to space software development. *[More info here →](/space-enthusiast/)*

After graduation, I joined the **[European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/)** in the Netherlands as a Trainee (2018-2020), working on Mission Control Systems and helping improve the onboarding processes for early-career engineers. *[More info here →](/space-enthusiast/)*

Since 2020, I've been a **Ph.D. student** at the [Human Aspects of Software Engineering Lab](https://hasel.dev/) at the University of Zurich, supervised by [Prof. Thomas Fritz](https://hasel.dev/team/thomas-fritz/). My research focuses on developer productivity, and I've supervised 10+ students through their theses while publishing at top conferences like ICSE and CSCW. *[More info here →](/productivity-researcher/)*

Now, as an **AI Engineer** at appliedAI, I'm bringing together everything I've learned – software engineering, research, and a passion for building tools that help people work better – to create enterprise AI solutions that actually make a difference. *[More info here →](/ai-engineer/)*

## What Drives Me

I'm passionate about leveraging technology to improve people's lives. Whether it's building satellites for space missions, creating AI tools that help developers be more productive, or contributing to open source projects, I love solving complex problems and making an impact. *[More about my interests →](/other-stuff/)*
