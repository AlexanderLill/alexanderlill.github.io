## Research Focus

I am a **Ph.D. student** at the [Human Aspects of Software Engineering Lab (HASEL)](https://hasel.dev/) at the University of Zurich, supervised by [Prof. Thomas Fritz](https://hasel.dev/team/thomas-fritz/). My research focuses on **Software Developer Experience & Productivity** – understanding how developers work and building tools to help them work better.

My research is deeply informed by my practical experience as a [software engineer](/software-engineer/) with 15+ years of building systems, giving me unique insights into real-world developer challenges.

## Research Areas

My work sits at the intersection of:
- **Developer Productivity**: Understanding what makes developers productive and how to measure it
- **AI-Driven Tools**: Building intelligent tools using generative AI to boost developer workflows
- **Knowledge Management**: Helping developers find, organize, and reuse information effectively
- **Personal Information Management**: Supporting developers in managing their digital work artifacts
- **Developer Experience**: Improving the overall experience of software development

## Ph.D. Thesis

My dissertation focuses on **building tools for enhancing software developer experience and productivity**. I use a combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods, including surveys, interviews, field studies, and controlled experiments to understand developer needs and validate tool effectiveness.

## Supervised Projects

I have supervised **10+ students** through their master's and bachelor's theses and projects, guiding them end-to-end through the research process:

- "CA$H: Collaborative Agent Software Hierarchy - An Agent-Based Approach for Concept Location and Change Propagation in Software Evolution" (Master Project, 2025)
- "Generating FAQs from Chat Conversations" (Master Project, 2024)
- "Educational AI Companion for ACCESS" (Master Project, 2024)
- "Task-Management with Microtasking" (Bachelor Thesis, 2023)
- "ScreenCurator – Curation of digital knowledge with screenshots" (Bachelor Thesis, 2023)
- "Detecting Related Stack Overflow Posts for Discord Conversations" (Master Thesis, 2022)
- "I am Stuck. Characteristics of Stuck Phases During Software Development" (Bachelor Thesis, 2022)
- "P.E.T. calendar – A time-management software that considers energy levels" (Bachelor Thesis, 2022)
- "AmbientTeams: Staying socially connected in remote knowledge work teams" (Master Thesis, 2021)
- "Self-experimentation and Reflection at Work to Form Productive Habits" (Master Project, 2021)

## Research Methods

My research employs a diverse methodological toolkit:
- **Quantitative Research**: Surveys, statistical analysis, data mining
- **Qualitative Research**: Interviews, thematic analysis
- **Field Studies**: Real-world deployments and evaluations
- **Controlled Experiments**: Lab studies to test specific hypotheses
- **Tool Building**: Creating research prototypes and production-ready tools

## Academic Engagement

Beyond my core research, I've been actively involved in the academic community:

- **Interdisciplinary Research Assistant** (2022-2025): Member of the Digital Society Initiative Excellence Program at UZH, working across faculties on interdisciplinary challenges including AI usage surveys and health innovation
- **Junior Researcher Representative** (2022-2024): Represented junior researchers at the faculty assembly through the Association of Junior Researchers (VAUZ)

## From Research to Practice

My research insights now directly inform my work as an [AI Engineer at appliedAI](/ai-engineer/), where I build AI-powered tools for enterprise environments. The combination of academic rigor and practical engineering experience allows me to create solutions that are both theoretically sound and practically useful.
